## **Introduction**

This machine learning model was made to predict Life Expectancy using multiple linear regression and regularization (Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet) algorithms.

The Life Expectancy dataset was from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).

## **Context**

Although there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.

## **Content**

The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from United Nation website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative. It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis.

## **Problem**

Life expectancy is the average number of years of life that is still lived by someone who has reached a certain age. Life Expectancy is a tool to evaluate government performance in improving the welfare of the population in general and improving health status in particular for a country. The purpose of this model is to estimate the life expectancy of a country based on several variables, so that the government or World Health Organization (WHO) has a benchmark in determining policies to further improve the health and health of the people in the concerned countries.

## **Conclusion**

**Best Model**
- Based on the evaluation matrix, we will use the Ridge Tuned with One Hot Encoding dataframe model for predicting the life expectancy of a country. 

**Impact**
- This model will enable WHO, Government, or other related policy makers to set a target and create policy more accurate and effective. This model can be used as a benchmark for the related policy makers to oversee the target to ensure the policy that has been made is successfull to increase life expectancy of the country's.
